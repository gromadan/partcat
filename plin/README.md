This folder contains a Singular library `plin.lib` that can be used for computing with linear combinations of partitions. Its usage is illustrated in the jupyter notebook `Remark_4_13.ipynb`, which refers to a computation in [2, Remark 4.13].

This library is not yet very well documented. If anybody is interested in using it, but is not sure how it works, please do not hesitate to contact me on the below mentioned e-mail address.
