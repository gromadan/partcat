# partcat

This repository contains tools for working with (linear) categories of partitions.

  * `words` -- a C++ code for categories of partitions (no linear combinations)
  * `plin`  -- a Singular library for computing with linear combinations of partitions
  * `lincat` -- a Singular code for approximating linear categories of partitions

See the README files in the corresponding folders for more information.
